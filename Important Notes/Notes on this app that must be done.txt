WE WANT TO SAVE OUR PROGRESS TO VERSION CONTROL OR SOURCE CONTROL:
-Install Github and git bash
-Make sure you have a github account
-Go to profile->Settings->Developer Settings->Personal access token->Tokens Classic->Generate new token->Generate new token (classic)->Give it a note or name->No expiration->Check all the boxes->Generate Token->Copy the token and save it somewhere and use the token for your password, because of pushing and comitting code to my github repo
-This is mey generated token: Use the following token/password when comitting things to my personal github: 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
-Go to the project and open up git bash or any terminal or my choice:
-Type git status -> It will say "not a git repo"
-Go to github and create a new repository
-Follow all the steps to commit and push on github
-Create a .gitignore file-> Watch a vido on youtube how to create on visual studio
-Go back to see the changes, you'll see that the changes are less now
-We also dont want the appsettings.json file to be included in the commits so right click and add to .gitignore file

MAKE THE FRONTEND RUN ON HTTPS INSTEAD OF JUST SO IT AN BE THE SAME AS THE BACKEND RUNNING ON HTTPS
-Go to the studentassets folder->generateTrustedSSL
-Click on server and do all the steps.
-Create a ssl folder in the client app
-Copy the server and server.ky files and paste it in the ssl folder from the generateTrustedSSL folder
-Go to angular.json file and under serve add the following object-> "options":{
            "sslCert": "./ssl/server.crt",
            "sslKey": "./ssl/server.key",
            "ssl": true
          },
-Restart the application and rerun ng serve -o
-Go to the lock next to the url and check the certicate

WHEN CREATING SERVICES IN THE API IT'S IMPORTANT TO CREATE INTERFACES AND IMPLEMENTATION/SERVICE CLASS AT THE SAME TIME AND DEFINE THEM ASS BUILDER.SERVICE.ADDSCOPE(...) in the program.cs class - Section 4 video 41.

TO ENSURE THAT ONLY AUTHORISED USERS CAN ACCESS A SPECIFIC ENDPOINT:
-Do it on top of the http request in a controllers method eg. [Authorize] and you can also add [AllowAnonymous], but not at the beginning of the controller

IF WE WANT SOME OF THE LINKS TO BE PROTECTED THAT A NON LOGGED INUSER SHOULDNT ACCESS:
-We should consider using AuthGuard.ts which is an extra file that should be created to see if theres already a user that exists in that observable we created.
-Go to app-routing.module.ts file and add the canActivate property to one of the paths in your Routes array.
-Angular or the client side can never give us security its only the api that can code security. The Client only hides stuff for us

FOR ANY THIRD PARTIES IMPORTS IN ANGULAR APPLICATION
-Use an extra module besides app.module.ts that is shared.module.ts
-If we want the imports to work in the shared.module.ts we also need to export them, creating an export array the same as the imports array
