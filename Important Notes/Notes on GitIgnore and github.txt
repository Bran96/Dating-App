We want to save our progress to source control or version control:
-Install Git
-Make sure you have a github account
-Go to profile->Settings->Developer Settings->Personal access token->Tokens Classic->Generate new token->Generate new token (classic)->Give it a note or name->No expiration->Check all the boxes->Generate Token->Copy the token and save it somewhere and use the token for your password, because of pushing and comitting code to my github repo
-This is mey generated token: Use the following token/password when comitting things to my personal github: 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
-Go to the project and open up git bash or any terminal or my choice:
-Type git status -> It will say "not a git repo"
-Now we initialize this project leve as a git repo: type "git init"
-Do git status or look at the changes on vs code, you'll see the changes
-Ill see that there are changes that we dont want to commit
-Create a .gitignore file-> Watch a vido on youtube how to create on visual studio
-Go back to see the changes, you'll see that the changes are less now
-We also dont want the appsettings.json file to be included in the commits so right click and add to .gitignore file
-We are ready to commit and push to github repo. First in vs go to account settings on your profile pic.
-Then click on account settings, make sure you have github account under all accounts.
- Do the commit and push in visual studio then and check github website to see if there are any changes reflecting there
